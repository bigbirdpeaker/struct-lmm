Structured Linear Mixed Model (StructLMM) is a computationally efficient method to
test for and characterize loci that interact with multiple environments [1].

This a standalone module that implements the basic functionalities of StructLMM.
However, we recommend using StructLMM via
[LIMIX2](https://limix.readthedocs.io/en/2.0.0/index.html) as this additionally
implements:

- Multiple methods for GWAS;
- Methods to characterize GxE at specific variants;
- Command line interface.

## Install

From terminal, it can be installed using [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip):

```bash
pip install struct-lmm
```
